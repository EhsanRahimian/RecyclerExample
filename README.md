# RecyclerExample
use a RecyclerView to display list items with an image and text.
You'll learn to build a recyclerview adapter class from scratch and display images and text. 
To retrieve the images from the internet we use the "Glide" library.
This is a perfect example if you're a beginner and need a step-by-step example on how to use a recyclerview in your android project.
There is 2 branches here,
RecyclerView_Bitmap branch: The app will have a single activity with a Vertical RecyclerView,
RecyclerView_onClickListener branch: The app have the secound activity to open the particular item.
